### Defense and material size qualifiers
- **Defensive tags** appear in the Abilities or Notes columns to show how a species avoids harm: Venom (poison bite/sting), Spined (quills, barbs), Camouflage (visual or scent masking), Armor (plating or dense bone), Burrow Escape (rapid tunneling), Shock/Frost/Fire Warding (elemental resilience), and Pack Guard (allies cover retreats).
- **Material size markers** attach to each hide, fang, or claw entry to qualify crafting output: `[T]` tiny (insects, hatchlings), `[S]` small (foxes, fowl), `[M]` medium (wolves, deer), `[L]` large (elk, ursines), `[XL]` titanic (rocs, leviathans). Materials retain species names for clarity—e.g., `MAT-212 Ashmane Wolf Pelt [M]` or `MAT-005 Glacial Roc Talon [XL]`.
- **Standardized loot naming**: every harvested item now begins with the species name, followed by its material and size tag where relevant (meat, pelt/hide, horn, fang, and talon/hoof pieces all observe this format). Legacy generic loot IDs persist but resolve to species-specific names in this index.
