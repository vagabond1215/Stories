# Fantasy RPG Reference Database

This directory contains a modular, cross-referenced knowledge base for a fantasy RPG world. Each file focuses on one domain while sharing common identifiers to maintain consistency and support future indexing/searching.

## File map
- [templates.md](templates.md) — Shared ID scheme and data entry templates.
- [fauna.md](fauna.md) — Bestiary entries with spawn, abilities, and loot.
- [flora.md](flora.md) — Plants, fungi, and harvest details.
- [materials.md](materials.md) — Mined/harvested resources and refined materials.
- [equipment.md](equipment.md) — Weapons, armor, accessories, consumables.
- [crafting_recipes.md](crafting_recipes.md) — Recipes linking ingredients, tools, and structures.
- [technology.md](technology.md) — Technology tree with unlocks and prerequisites.
- [structures.md](structures.md) — Buildings, furniture, and tools tied to technologies.
- [spells.md](spells.md) — Spell list with elements and schools.
- [profiles.md](profiles.md) — Player and settlement profiles.
- [inventories.md](inventories.md) — Current inventories referencing profiles and items.

## Indexing/search guidance
- Unique IDs (e.g., `FAU-001`, `EQP-003`) are stable across files for cross-linking.
- Tables use consistent column headers to simplify parsing.
- Use the templates to add new entries and keep references synchronized across files.
- When adding new IDs, also update related recipes, technologies, and inventories to preserve traceability.
