### Defensive adaptations and yield size markers
- **Defensive tags** listed in Hazards/notes indicate how flora resists harvesting: Thorned (spines, barbs), Caustic Sap (acidic resin), Poison (toxic oils), Camouflage (bark/leaf mimicry), Sporeburst (defensive cloud), and Hardened Bark (armor plates).
- **Yield size markers** denote how much material is recovered: `[S]` sprig/young growth, `[M]` mature stand, `[L]` giant/ancient specimen. When applied, material names remain species-specific, e.g., `MAT-001 Sunmoss Fibre [S]` or `MAT-103 Dawnspire Oak Nuts/Acorns [M]`.
