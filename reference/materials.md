| MAT-002 | Bog Iron Nugget | Ore | Fenlow Mire peat beds; dredging pools; BIO-006 wetlands | Smelt via CRF-001 | CRF-001, TEC-001 | Oxide-rich; low melting point |
| MAT-003 | Bog Iron Ingot | Metal | Smelted from MAT-002 at STR-001 | Hammered or quenched | EQP-001, EQP-002, CRF-002, SPL-003 | Slightly brittle unless alloyed |
| MAT-004 | Roc Feather | Exotic reagent | Loot: FAU-001; BIO-009 alpine nests | Cured; fletched | EQP-001, SPL-001 focus | Holds latent wind mana |
| MAT-005 | Frost-Touched Talon | Exotic reagent | Loot: FAU-001; BIO-009 glacial roosts | Polished shard | SPL-001 component | Radiates low ambient chill |
| MAT-006 | Azure Quartz | Crystal | Loot veins near FAU-002 nests; BIO-006 bog shelves | Cut and set | EQP-003, SPL-001 conduit | Stores aether; glows when spells prepped |
| MAT-007 | Salamander Scale | Creature scale | Loot: FAU-003; BIO-010 vents | Tempered; lamellar | EQP-002, CRF-004 | Fire-resistant; flexes under heat |
| MAT-008 | Emberreed Resin | Resin | Harvest: FLR-003; BIO-010 geothermal vents | Distilled to pitch | CRF-005, fuel for STR-001 | Burns cleanly; good for sealant |
| MAT-510 | Amber Barley Grain | Grain | FLR-326 steppe terraces (BIO-005) | Threshed and winnowed | CRF-030 breads and porridges | Keep dry; hulls irritate skin |
| MAT-511 | Barley Straw | Straw | FLR-326 stalk bundles | Sun-dried in sheaves | EQP-030 thatch, EQP-031 bedding | Prickly until retted |

| MAT-513 | Rye Straw | Straw | FLR-327 stalk bundles | Shock-dried, then bundled | EQP-030 thatch | Durable when tightly bound |
| MAT-514 | Golden Wheat Grain | Grain | FLR-328 steppe terraces (BIO-005) | Flail-threshed; winnowed clean | CRF-032 risen loaves and noodles | Stores best in cool granaries |
| MAT-515 | Wheat Straw | Straw | FLR-328 stems | Sun-dried and combed | EQP-030 thatch, EQP-031 bedding | Light but brittle when over-dried |
| MAT-516 | Terrace Rice Grain | Grain | FLR-329 irrigated paddies (BIO-003) | Dehulled and polished | CRF-033 steamed cakes, CRF-034 rice wine | Spoils if not fully dried |
| MAT-517 | Rice Husk | Husk fibre | FLR-329 outer hulls | Dried and parched | EQP-031 bedding, CRF-038 fuel briquettes | Fine dust irritates lungs |
| MAT-518 | Highland Oat Groats | Grain | FLR-330 upland steppes (BIO-005) | Kiln-dried then hulled | CRF-035 travel porridges | Turns rancid if stored damp |
| MAT-519 | Oat Straw | Straw | FLR-330 stems | Dried and bundled | EQP-031 bedding and thatch | Soft; mats easily under weight |
