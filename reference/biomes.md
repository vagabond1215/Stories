# Biomes, Habitats, and Landmass Types

| ID | Name | Category | Landmass type | Climate/Environment | Notable features | Native flora/fauna/material IDs | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BIO-001 | Tropical Rainforest | Biome | Continental interior; large islands | Hot, humid canopy; daily storms; poor but rapid-growth soils | Buttress-rooted giants, hanging lianas, cloud-piercing plateaus | Future expansion; suitable for arboreal megafauna and rare herbs | River gorges and orchid canopies make traversal vertical-heavy |
| BIO-002 | Temperate Rainforest | Biome | Coastal continent; misted peninsulas | Cool, wet year-round; heavy fog; moss-laden cliffs | Nurse logs, dripping ferns, waterfalls | FLR-001 Sunmoss, MAT-001 Sunmoss Fibre | Steady rain keeps flammables damp; dense canopy muffles sound |
| BIO-003 | Boreal Forest (Taiga) | Biome | Continental shield | Long winters; brief thaw; acidic soil | Conifer spires, peat undergrowth | Future expansion for conifer resin and hardy fauna | Frozen bogs crack loudly under weight in late thaw |
| BIO-004 | Steppe | Biome | Continental interior plateau | Semi-arid; strong winds; cold nights | Deep loam grasses, isolated wells | Future grazing megafauna; potential MAT ores near escarpments | Open sightlines favor mounted combat and ambush from burrows |
| BIO-005 | Savannah | Biome | Continental plateau and basins | Seasonal rains; tall grass; scattered trees | Acacia groves, firebreak stone outcrops | Future herd beasts and fire-adapted flora | Dry season burns race quickly; smoke columns seen leagues away |
| BIO-006 | Wetlands & Mire | Habitat | Continental lowlands; estuary fringes | Waterlogged peat; slow currents; heavy fog | Bog pools, hanging lantern reeds, peat iron | FLR-002 Gloomcap Fungus, FAU-002 Bog Myconid, MAT-002 Bog Iron Nugget, MAT-006 Azure Quartz | Unstable footing favors creatures with reach or snares; fires smother |
| BIO-007 | Coral Reef | Habitat | Archipelago shelves; atolls; island chains | Warm, clear water; strong sunlight; tidal surges | Coral bommies, kelp curtains, sand channels | Future expansion for reef fish, pearls, alchemical corals | Requires boats or swimming; storms can strip shallow shelves |
| BIO-008 | Estuary Delta | Habitat | River mouth on continent or peninsula | Brackish tides; shifting silt; mangroves | Mudflats, eelgrass, tidal pools | Future shellfish, salt-hardy reeds | Salinity swings affect gear; twice-daily currents mask scents |
| BIO-009 | Alpine Highlands | Biome | Continental or peninsula mountain ranges | Thin air; freezing winds; snowbound passes | Sheer cliffs, ice spires, glacial nests | FAU-001 Glacial Roc, MAT-004 Roc Feather, MAT-005 Frost-Touched Talon, FLR-001 Sunmoss | Updrafts enable aerial ambush; rope or flight needed for ledges |
| BIO-010 | Volcanic Springs & Ash Bogs | Habitat | Rift islands; volcanic peninsulas; continental vents | Steam vents; mineral-rich mud; shifting heat pockets | Geothermal pools, obsidian shards, ash-coated reeds | FLR-003 Emberreed, FAU-003 Emberfen Salamander, MAT-007 Salamander Scale, MAT-008 Emberreed Resin | Sudden geysers scald; heat-loving fauna defend vents and forges |
